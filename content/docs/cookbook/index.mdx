## Content Format

**Tutorials** follow a consistent structure:
1. Prerequisites - What you need before starting
2. Overview - What you'll build and learn
3. Step-by-step implementation
4. Testing & validation
5. Next steps

**Recipes** are self-contained solutions:
1. Problem - What you're trying to solve
2. Solution - Complete, working code
3. How it works - Key concepts explained
4. Variations - Alternative approaches
