# Core Concepts

Before diving into implementation, it helps to understand the foundational concepts that power Brokle. These concepts form the building blocks for monitoring, evaluating, and improving your AI applications.

## The Observability Stack

Brokle provides a complete observability stack for AI applications:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph App["Your AI Application"]
        direction LR
        T[Traces] --- S[Spans] --- Sess[Sessions] --- E[Evaluations] --- C[Costs]
    end

    subgraph Platform["Brokle Platform"]
        direction LR
        Ing[Ingestion] --> Ana[Analytics] --> Dash[Dashboard]
    end

    App --> Platform
```

    href="/docs/concepts/cost-analytics"
  />
</Cards>

## How They Connect

Understanding how these concepts relate helps you design effective observability:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Session["Session (User Conversation)"]
        T1[Trace 1: First message]
        T2[Trace 2: Follow-up]
        T3[Trace 3: Final response]
    end

    subgraph Trace1["Trace 1 Details"]
        S1[Span: Retrieve docs]
        S2[Span: LLM call]
        S3[Span: Format response]
    end

    T1 --> Trace1
    S2 --> E1[Evaluation: Quality score]
    S2 --> C1[Cost: $0.02]
```

### Hierarchy

1. **Sessions** group multiple traces from the same user or conversation
2. **Traces** capture complete request-response cycles
3. **Spans** represent individual operations within a trace
4. **Evaluations** attach quality metrics to spans or traces
5. **Cost Analytics** aggregate spending across all levels

## Core Principles

### 1. Minimal Code Changes

Brokle integrates with your existing code without major refactoring:

```python
from brokle import Brokle, wrap_openai
import openai

client = Brokle(api_key="bk_...")
openai_client = wrap_openai(openai.OpenAI(), brokle=client)

# Your existing code works unchanged
response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(...)
```

### 2. OpenTelemetry Compatible

Brokle is built on OpenTelemetry standards, ensuring:

- Interoperability with existing observability tools
- Standardized trace and span formats
- Easy integration with your infrastructure

### 3. Privacy First

- Sensitive data masking options
- On-premise deployment available
- No data leaves your infrastructure (self-hosted)

### 4. Real-Time Insights

- Live trace streaming
- Instant cost calculations
- Real-time quality scoring

<Callout type="info">
  All concepts support both automatic instrumentation (via integrations) and manual instrumentation (via SDK) for maximum flexibility.
