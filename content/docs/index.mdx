# Welcome to Brokle

Brokle is **the AI engineering platform for AI teams**. Whether you're building chatbots, RAG systems, or AI agents, Brokle provides the observability, evaluation, and management tools you need to ship with confidence.

## Why Brokle?

Building AI applications is hard. Understanding why they fail is harder. Brokle solves this by giving you complete visibility into every AI interaction:

- **Trace every AI call** - See exactly what goes in and out of your models and agents
- **Evaluate quality at scale** - Score outputs automatically with built-in and custom evaluators
- **Track costs in real-time** - Know exactly how much you're spending per request
- **Manage prompts** - Version, test, and deploy prompts with confidence
- **Self-host or cloud** - Run on your infrastructure or use our managed service

## Quick Start

Get started with Brokle in under 5 minutes:

```bash tab="Python"
pip install brokle
```

```bash tab="JavaScript"
npm install @brokle/sdk
```

Then start tracing your AI calls:

```python tab="Python"
from brokle import Brokle

client = Brokle(api_key="your-api-key")

with client.trace("my-first-trace") as trace:
    # Your AI code automatically gets traced
    response = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
    )
```

```javascript tab="JavaScript"
import { Brokle } from '@brokle/sdk';

const client = new Brokle({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });

await client.trace('my-first-trace', async () => {
  // Your AI code automatically gets traced
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }]
  });
});
```

## Architecture

Brokle is built as a **scalable monolith** designed for both self-hosting and cloud deployment:

- **HTTP Server** - REST API for data ingestion and querying
- **Background Workers** - Process telemetry streams asynchronously
- **PostgreSQL** - Transactional data (projects, users, prompts)
- **ClickHouse** - High-performance analytics and trace storage
- **Redis** - Caching and job queues

## Open Source

Brokle's core platform is open source under the MIT license. We believe observability tools should be transparent, customizable, and free from vendor lock-in. Enterprise features are available for teams that need advanced capabilities.
